# Instructor Behavior Analyzer

A web app to analyze instructor tone and behavior from Vimeo videos using OpenAI GPT or NLP.

I have used the following two raw files:
01. For unprofessional words https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onshadeep/unprofessional_words/refs/heads/main/unprofessional_words.txt
02. For red flag words https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onshadeep/unprofessional_words/refs/heads/main/red_flags.txt

Important: If you want to add more words or phrases to the unprofessional or red flag files, you can do so directly from your GitHub repository. You do not need to modify the existing or running code.

Steps to run the project on your local machine
01. pip install -r requirements.txt
02. python -m textblob.download_corpora
03. python backend/main.py
